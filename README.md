# CumulativePersistenceTest
This code shows how to run the cumulative persistence test in R, with a few examples interspersed. Though the way it is run in these examples is using a multicore wrapper as to allow for many replications of the process. In practice, it may be more useful not to run the test in this way. The file labelled CumulativePersistenceTest is commented and laid out in a more structured way.
The file labelled Uncommented Code and Examples contains the original examples ran in R. Though it is likely highly non-linear in its organization, and some variables are not named properly.
